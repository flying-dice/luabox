# geometry

The LuaCATS/`.d.lua` flagship. A library (`edition = "5.4"`) whose types live
in an ambient **definition package** — a `---@meta` file resolved by
`[types] defs` — while the implementations are ordinary Lua, annotated with
stock LuaLS tags (`---@class` / `---@field` / `---@param` / `---@return` /
`---@alias` / `---@enum`). No imports.

> This example documents, honestly, what LuaCATS gives you **today**: what
> works, what luabox enforces *more strictly* than lua-language-server, and
> what is still out of reach. Read to the end — some of this will surprise
> you.

## The LuaCATS workflow

1. **Declare types in a `.d.lua` def package.** `defs/geometry.d.lua` is a
   `---@meta` module declaring `geometry.Point`, the interface-shaped
   `geometry.Shape`, `geometry.Drawable : geometry.Shape`, the carrier
   classes `geometry.Circle`/`geometry.Rect`, and the `geometry.Unit` alias.
   It's wired in with `[types] defs = ["geometry"]` — the file stem
   `geometry` resolves to `defs/geometry.d.lua` (same mechanism
   `love-asteroids-lite` uses for `defs/love2d.d.lua`).

   **These defs are geometry's published type surface.** Because they are
   declared in `[types] defs`, any package that *depends* on geometry gets
   them ambiently too (the luals `workspace.library` model, #108) — see
   `../renderer`, which conforms to `geometry.Drawable` across the package
   boundary with no vendored copy.

2. **Re-open the class where it's implemented.** `src/circle.lua` declares
   `---@class geometry.Circle : geometry.Shape` again on `local Circle = {}`.
   luabox merges declarations of the same class name, so `self.radius`
   resolves to `number` from the field declared in the `.d.lua` file even
   though circle.lua doesn't repeat it. `self` inside `:` methods is
   inferred through the `__index` metatable chain — no extra annotation.

3. **Consume through standard annotations.** `---@type geometry.Point` on a
   table literal, `---@param`/`---@return` on functions — nothing new.

4. **Check it.**

```sh
luabox check        # 0 errors across 4 files
luabox fmt --check   # 5 files formatted
luabox lint          # 0 errors, 0 warnings
luabox test          # 9 passing tests
```

## What actually works (verified against the real binary)

- **`---@class` + `---@field`, `---@param`/`---@return`.** Full support,
  same as any LuaLS-aware editor.
- **`: Interface` conformance IS verified** (#107 — the strictness luals
  declares but trusts). A `---@class geometry.Circle : geometry.Shape`
  carrier must actually provide every member `geometry.Shape` declares, with
  a compatible signature. Delete `Circle:perimeter` from `src/circle.lua`
  and `luabox check` now reports (reproduced against this exact file, then
  reverted):
  ```
  error[LB0300]: `geometry.Circle` does not satisfy `geometry.Shape`: missing member `perimeter`
     --> src/circle.lua:19:4
     |
  19 | ---@class geometry.Circle : geometry.Shape
     |    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected member `perimeter` of type `fun(self: unknown): number`
  ```
  Give a member the wrong type (e.g. `Circle:area` returning a `string`) and
  it is flagged the same way (`member \`area\` has the wrong type`). The check
  is `__index`-aware: a subclass that inherits a concrete base method through
  its metatable chain is **not** told to re-implement it, so classic
  inheritance stays clean. This is real structural conformance: an interface
  carrier that lies about implementing the interface is caught at `check` time.
- **Field reads ARE checked** (#90 — luals `undefined-field`, ridden one
  notch stricter). Reading a field a declared class does not provide —
  `self.nope` inside a `geometry.Circle` method, or `p.nope` on a `---@type
  geometry.Point` local — is a real `check` error under `strict` (a warning
  in warn mode; luals always warns). Add `local _ = self.nope` to
  `Circle:area` in `src/circle.lua` and `luabox check` reports (reproduced
  against this exact file, then reverted):
  ```
  error[LB0306]: undefined field `nope` on `geometry.Circle`
     --> src/circle.lua:29:15
     |
  29 |     local _ = self.nope
     |               ^^^^^^^^^ `geometry.Circle` declares no field `nope`
     --> src/circle.lua:23:4
     |
  23 | ---@class geometry.Circle : geometry.Shape
     |    --------------------------------------- `geometry.Circle` declared here
  ```
  The obligation follows the *declaration*: inherited fields (through the
  parent chain), inherent carrier methods, and classes with an indexer all
  stay clean, while un-annotated code invents no obligation. A genuinely
  dynamic access opts out with `---@diagnostic disable: undefined-field`.
- **Literal sealing.** `---@type geometry.Point` on a table literal enforces
  every non-optional field present and rejects unknown keys — `LB0300`
  ("missing `y`") / `LB0303` ("unknown field `z`") — for any LuaCATS
  `---@class` under `[types] strict = true`. (LuaLS treats this as a soft
  `missing-fields` warning in most editors; here it's a real `check` error.)
  See the commented block in `src/shapes_data.lua`.
- **`---@alias` and `---@enum`.** Both are fully enforced. `geometry.Unit =
  "px"|"pt"` rejects any other string at an annotated position
  (`error[LB0300]: type mismatch: expected \`"px"|"pt"\`, found \`"cm"\``);
  `geometry.ShapeKind` (an `---@enum` over a real runtime table) rejects any
  value that isn't one of its members the same way.
- **`T[]` / `table<K,V>`.** Both check element/value types precisely
  (verified in the mission's scratch experiments, not shown in this
  project's own files, but exercised — see the mission report).
- **`---@meta` ambient globals**, including framework/DLL-style ones — see
  `../love-asteroids-lite/defs/love2d.d.lua` for that pattern; this
  project's own `defs/geometry.d.lua` is the same mechanism applied to a
  library's own types rather than a third-party API.

## Generics — now real (#84)

Both generic forms luals supports are implemented here, matched to luals
semantics (ecosystem parity, not a luabox invention):

- **Generic `---@class<T>`.** `defs/geometry.d.lua` declares a real
  `geometry.Pair<T>` with `first`/`second` both typed `T`. A reference
  substitutes the type argument per use site: `src/shapes_data.lua` pins
  `---@type geometry.Pair<number>`, so both fields are checked as numbers.
  Put a string in one and it is a real `luabox check` error:
  ```
  error[LB0300]: type mismatch: expected `number`, found `"two"`
    --> src/shapes_data.lua
    |
    | local bad = { first = 1, second = "two" }
    |                                   ^^^^^ expected `number`
  ```
  Referencing `T` in a `---@field` no longer trips `LB0305`; a bare
  `geometry.Pair` with no type arguments stays lenient (parameters become
  `unknown`), exactly as luals treats it; and nesting works
  (`geometry.Pair<geometry.Pair<number>>`).
- **`---@generic` functions.** `T` is inferred from the argument types at the
  call site (first-binding-wins, luals-style) and substituted into the
  return type, so `local n = id(5)` types `n` as `integer` and using it
  where a string is required errors. Bounded parameters (`---@generic T :
  Shape`) are checked: a binding that does not satisfy the constraint reports
  `LB0300` at the argument. A backtick capture (`` ---@param cls `T` ``) binds
  `T` to the class *named by* a string-literal argument — the generic
  constructor idiom. See `../workspace/packages/core/src/core.lua` for a
  `---@generic` function (`first_or`) in a real module.

`: Interface` conformance is also checked (see above). Cross-*package* type
sharing — a dependency's ambient defs (classes, aliases, enums, and
def-declared global APIs) visible and checked in a consumer — now works too
(#108, the luals `workspace.library` model): geometry's own `[types] defs` are
its published type surface, and `../renderer` conforms to `geometry.Drawable`
across the package boundary with no vendored copy.

Cross-*file* `require` resolution now works as well (#85): a
`local Circle = require("circle")` in `tests/geometry_test.lua` is typed from
`src/circle.lua`'s annotations, so `Circle.new(2):area()` types through and a
method the class does not declare — `Circle.new(2):nonexistent()` — is a real
`luabox check` error (`LB0306`) reported at the test's call site, not silently
`unknown`. The module's `return` value evaluates to the required file's export
type (matching lua-language-server), so conformance-style assertions work in
consumer and test files, not just the defining file. (Requires that resolve
nowhere stay `unknown` and raise no diagnostic; the bundler is where an
unresolvable static `require` is a hard error.)

## Constructors under LuaCATS

```lua
---@param radius number
---@return geometry.Circle
function Circle.new(radius)
    return setmetatable({ radius = radius }, Circle)
end
```

The `---@param` type flows into the body; the `setmetatable(literal,
Circle)` result is checked against the declared `---@return geometry.Circle`
— literal freshness (sealing) applies at that return position exactly as it
does at a `---@type` binding.
