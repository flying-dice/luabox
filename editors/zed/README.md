# luabox for Zed

A [Zed](https://zed.dev) extension that adds the **luabox language server**
(`luabox lsp`) for Lua files — typecheck, hover, goto-definition, completion,
document symbols, formatting and semantic highlighting.

## Requirements

- A `luabox` binary on your `PATH` (build it from the repo root with
  `cargo build --release`; binary: `target/release/luabox`), or a path set in
  Zed settings (below). The server is launched as `luabox lsp`.

## How it attaches to Lua

Zed ships Lua support already. This extension declares the luabox server for
the `Lua` language in `extension.toml`, so Zed makes it **available**
automatically alongside any other Lua server — no settings edit and no
`languages/lua/` override that would clobber Zed's built-in Lua highlighting.

To control ordering or disable another server, add to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "Lua": { "language_servers": ["luabox", "..."] }
  }
}
```

(`"..."` expands to the remaining available servers; prefix a name with `"!"`
to disable it.)

## Configuring the binary path

Point Zed at a specific `luabox` binary (and/or override the args) in
`settings.json`:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "luabox": {
      "binary": {
        "path": "/absolute/path/to/luabox",
        "arguments": ["lsp"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Without an override the extension resolves `luabox` on the worktree `PATH` and
runs `luabox lsp`.

## Install as a dev extension

1. Build the wasm (sanity check — Zed also compiles it on install):

   ```sh
   rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
   cd editors/zed
   cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 --release
   ```

2. In Zed: **Extensions ▸ Install Dev Extension**, and select this
   `editors/zed` directory.

## Publishing to the Zed extension registry

Extensions are published by PR to
[`zed-industries/extensions`](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions):

1. Host this extension in a **public git repo** with a license file at its root
   (MIT/Apache-2.0/BSD — mandatory).
2. Fork `zed-industries/extensions`; `git submodule init && git submodule update`.
3. Add your repo as a submodule:
   `git submodule add <url> extensions/luabox`.
4. Add to the top-level `extensions.toml`:

   ```toml
   [luabox]
   submodule = "extensions/luabox"
   version = "0.1.0"   # must match extension.toml at that commit
   ```

5. Run `pnpm sort-extensions`, open a PR. On merge Zed packages and publishes
   it. Update later with `git submodule update --remote` + a version bump PR.

Because this repo is self-hosted on a tailnet, publishing to the public
registry additionally requires mirroring this extension to a public git host
and updating the `repository` URL in `extension.toml`.
